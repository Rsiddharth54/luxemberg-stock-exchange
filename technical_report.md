# üìå***Techinical Report***

## 1. Project goals

This API is a FastAPI-based application designed to retrieve, process, and compare data from the Transition Pathway Initiative Centre (TPI). It provides a fully functional API for delivering data from key assessment frameworks developed by the TPI Centre, including ASCOR, Carbon Performance, and Management Quality. 
Our team‚Äôs specific objective is to collaborate with clients from the Luxembourg Stock Exchange to enhance existing endpoints and develop new ones tailored to their needs, including endpoints for serving both data and visual content.

### **Reflection from First Meeting**

**Meeting Time:** 12th May, 15:15‚Äì15:45 BST  
**Meeting Goal:** Identifies client needs and defines the necessary steps to address them.

### **Key Questions Answered**

#### 1. What key use cases should this API support?  
(For example: listing metrics, company profiles, sector data, etc.)

- The goal is to help data users better filter and use the dataset for their own needs.
- The **primary endpoint** is **entity-level data** (Company or Country).
- This should be broken down into different methodologies:
  - **CP** and **MQ** for companies.
- Results should be served by entity with the associated metrics.
- Users should ideally be able to specify which metrics they're interested in (all or specific ones).  
  **Example:**  
  - All metrics for German companies.  
  - All level 4 MQ metrics and CP alignment for Chinese companies.

#### 2. Which datasets from the TPI website are we building against?  
(If multiple datasets are needed, how should the API handle interactions between them?)

- Focus: **CP** and **MQ** (potentially link with **ASCOR** and **Banking**, depending on scope and time).
- Ideally, datasets will be **linked by entity** and other identifiers.  
  **Example:**  
  - Link through the geography code to the ASCOR dataset, allowing users to download ASCOR indicators alongside companies headquartered in that jurisdiction.

#### 3. How will you query these endpoints?  
(What filters and parameters are required? How should the API handle missing/incomplete data?)

- The API should return a **‚Äúdata not available‚Äù** or **relevant description** when data is missing.
- If a reason for missing data exists (e.g. insufficient company disclosure), it should be included in the response.

#### 4. Do you need chart images or raw data, or both?  
(If raw data is enough, which formats are preferred?)

- One of the **key goals** is to **include both graphs and underlying data** directly in the API.

### **List of Priorities After the Meeting**

1. Solve any remaining bugs that affect the rest of the work
2. Add filters for mass calls by region and sector.
3. Add the underlying CP assessment data for each company:
   - Use data from:
     - `CP Assessment.xlsx`
     - `CP Assessment Regional.xlsx`
     - Benchmarks from `Sector Benchmark.xlsx` (for Electric Utilities sector).
4. Use the data to create graphs on the website (see example at bottom of the page).
5. Add endpoints to serve **Banking data**.
6. Link datasets to allow:
   - Calling **ASCOR indicators** in a Country
   - Fetching companies headquartered in that country
7. Add other functionality as discussed and as time/interests allow, subject to **Jon's confirmation** (e.g. chatbot).

### **Reflection from Second Meeting**

**Meeting Time:** 19th May, 14:30 ‚Äì 15:30 BST
**Meeting Goal:** Assesses current version and identifies specific areas for improvement.
